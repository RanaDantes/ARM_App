            <h1>What is ARM?</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Associate Rule Mining (ARM)</strong> is a data mining technique used to uncover <strong>hidden patterns, correlations, and relationships</strong>
                within large datasets. Its primary goal is to discover interesting <strong>if-then relationships</strong>, known as <strong>association rules</strong>, that
                help describe how items or attributes co-occur in data. <br><br>
                Originally popularized through <strong>market basket analysis</strong>, ARM helps answer questions like:
                <blockquote class="fancy">
                    <strong>|</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<q>If a customer buys item A, how likely are they to also buy item B?</q>
                </blockquote>
                The ARM process typically involves two keys steps:
                <br>
                1. <strong>Frequent Itemset Generation</strong> - Identifyng item combinations that occur together frequently above a minimum support threshold.
                <br>
                2. <strong>Rule Generation</strong> - Creating strong and valid rules from these itemsets based on metrics like <strong>support, confidece, and lift.</strong>
                <br><br>
                One of the most foundational algorithms used in ARM is the <strong>Apriori algorithm</strong>, which systematically reduces the search space using the principle
                that <strong>all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.</strong> By translating raw data into understandable rules, ARM enables organizations to 
                extract actionable insights and enhance strategic outcomes.
